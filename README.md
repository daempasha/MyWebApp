# .NET Introduction
An inital look into .NET following the official videos.

## Here I looked at
- Get, Post, Delete routes
- Using middlewares like useRewriter to redirect paths and also creating a custom middleware using Use
- Using endpoint filters to validate a request.
- Dependency Injection
  -   Creating an interface to define all method to implement.
  -   Using an interface allows many types of task services to be created for example; in memory, database and allows functionality to remain the same.
  -   Replacing all methods with the task service allowing for much easier to read code and better maintainability.
